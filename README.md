# Elite Command

Elite Command is a web-based, turn-based, asynchronous multiplayer tactical
strategy game I wrote between 2010 and 2013. During this time, the game
gathered a small but hardcore, dedicated base of players. It was a product of
love, and rarely did a day go by that I didn't participate in a game.

Unfortunately, I had to shut the game down due to the monthly hosting bill
while I bootstrapped my startup. Since then, I have planned for a long time to
open source it so that it might see a future, whether as an example to learn
from, the start of another project, or simply a clone if anyone wants to host
it. Today, I have finally gotten around to it.

I don't presently have time to fully document the code, but the specs should
run and give a basic understanding of the most important parts. The app depends
on MongoDB, Redis, and Orbited (Python). If you want to get it running and
experience any difficulty, or if you have any questions about how parts of it
work, feel free to file an issue and I'll respond as soon as I can.

Elite Command provided a small community with a lot of fun while it was online,
and I hope that its code can further serve someone out there a purpose. If you
do put it online, be sure to let me know and we'll have a match! :)
